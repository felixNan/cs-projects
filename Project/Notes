--------------------------To do list

Update the value of filledCells properlly in autofill and redo/undo+check win in autofill+check if we have these issues in other commands

In order for us to dynamically allocate the space needed for a cell we need to implement the log_10 and roof function in order to know the length that we will need in order to represent the value of a cell

Validate for save and for validate - ILP

Generate - ILP

hint - ILP

-------------------------Tests we have done

Solve - without file, with file, with non existing file

Edit - Same as Edit

print_board - working good

set - also looks good, need more testing

undo\redo - Check and check!

save - worked from edit, solve

autofill - looks really good

CheckErroneous - looks fine now

Exit, Reset - Check with ValGrind, looks cool

--------------------------Remarks

Only in Solve mode: autofill, mark_errors, hint. Only in Edit mode: generate.

What is a good way to check erroneous? We don't like checking everything, very bad complexity

Send array of triplets that contains col,row,val of a cell that is filled so we add a constraint that this value equals 1 in the correct col and row (ILP)

Stack ----- (NumOfSol) run while didn't pop bottome with val == -1, untill then push every possible move with good values, pop when we get stuck somewhere/no next empty cell (solutions++)

-------------------------Questions

Do we need to put fixed values on zeroes when we save in edit mode and does it matter?

-------------------- The Archive of Forbidden Questions

Check if we autofill even if board is unsolveable but doesn't contain same number in block, cell and row

do we re/undo autofill and if so what do we print

ask Moshe if in reading from files, if m and n can be seperated (not in the same line)

Ask what is the exact meaning of erroneous, is the board is valid, or only no same number in block, column, row, question comes since num of solutions ignores 0 solution on board

Is it possible to have a cell both fixed and erroneous and how to print it (possible when entering same value in a row/.../... of a fixed cell) --- Cells can't be both, only fixed or erroneous.

What to print in edit mode - with dot for fixed? without? both? WTF? -- Cells are only fixed in Solve mode, not erroneous

What if we set the same value to the same cell twice, do we add it as a change to the linked list bitch? -- Yes, we add it

Moshe, listen you MOFO what the heck is going on with "[]" in edit? is it a required characters on input? or you're just messing up with us? Get your shit together. -- [] Are not part of the input
