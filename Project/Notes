Check if we autofill even if board is unsolveable but doesn't contain same number in block, cell and row

do we re/undo autofill and if so what do we print

ask Moshe if in reading from files, if m and n can be seperated (not in the same line)

-------------------- already sent mail about this questions ^^

remember to change current move to the returned move from addNextMove

Ask what is the exact meaning of erroneous, is the board is valid, or only no same number in block, column, row, question comes since num of solutions ignores 0 solution on board
