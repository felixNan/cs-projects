Check if we autofill even if board is unsolveable but doesn't contain same number in block, cell and row

do we re/undo autofill and if so what do we print

ask Moshe if in reading from files, if m and n can be seperated (not in the same line)

Ask what is the exact meaning of erroneous, is the board is valid, or only no same number in block, column, row, question comes since num of solutions ignores 0 solution on board

-------------------- already sent mail about this questions ^^

remember to change current move to the returned move from addNextMove

-------------------- New Questions

What if we set the same value to the same cell twice, do we add it as a change to the linked list bitch?

What is a good way to check erroneous? We don't like checking everything, very bad complexity

What to print in edit mode - with dot for fixed? without? both? WTF?

Do we really need to undo in reset or we can just temp board our way out of it?
